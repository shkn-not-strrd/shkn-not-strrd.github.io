### About Me:
As a restless tinkerer with diverse interests, I love taking things apart to learn how they work. I feel software development affords me the ability to combine my passion for the liberal arts with the challenge of new puzzles on a regular basis. Drawing on my experience in end-user support, I enjoy tackling UI/UX challenges and advocating for users. I learn by doing, and do not like to hoard my knowledge - supporting a mentee or a teammate in their success and growth brings me almost as much joy as seeing something I’ve made in the hands of the people it’s made for.

### Outreach:
*Apple Field Trip & Camp Champion*

Planned and executed small group events to build exciting educational experiences for youth groups such as scout troops, school classes, and sports teams. Inspired interest in STEAM fields through fun activities and technology-based creative camps.

*She Can Code IT - Co-Lead*

Apply my passion for education and mentorship through involvement with the women in technology group originated by Availity’s own champions. Collaborate on organizing and planning content for both the public group (and previously, the private internal chapter for Availity employees).

*Mentorship*
 
Mentoring software engineers at various levels (student thru mid-career) as my way of giving back to my community and the profession.

*Civic Orchestra of Jacksonville*

In addition to playing with the ensemble since its third season, I develop and lead community arts education outreach sessions around the city of Jacksonville with fellow musicians & board members.
